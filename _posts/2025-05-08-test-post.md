Gobekle Tepe in Turkey is an archaeological site dating back to the 10th millennium BCE, renowned as the world's oldest known temple complex. The site features monumental T-shaped pillars carved with animal reliefs and abstract symbols, which some researchers have noted bear striking similarities to ancient rock art symbols found in parts of Australia. These parallel motifs suggest a shared symbolic language or independent cultural expressions that echo across vast distances, highlighting the deep-rooted human impulse to record and interpret the natural world through symbolic imagery.
