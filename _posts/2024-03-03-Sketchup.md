**Design a Learning Space**

Posted on March 3, 2024

**Assignment:**

Create a learning space based on what inspired you during our visit to Steelcase. You might find the modalities that are listed in this document helpful to guide your thinking. Combine photos and your notes from our visit into an artifact (a hand-made drawing, a Google Doc, a Slides presentation, something else creative) and post to this Discussion.

This is my [Sketchup project](https://app.sketchup.com/share/tc/northAmerica/RFPTWfsAB8A?stoken=ipKwEuo-M1DaSFwKmjHLYIOyyzW5PYgM3DAyaVkmhrO7Hukkkkr5xs-puxNDr7HK&source=web). (no sign-in required!)

I used this assignment as a chance to learn Sketchup as an introduction to 3D.

I used our readings, our trip to Steelcase, as well as pages from a book called *A Pattern Language* (1977) from my dad for design tips/inspiration:
