I completed the "Diagramming Foundations" course offered by Lucid. This comprehensive course provided a foundational understanding of Lucidchart and its features. The course covered basic navigation, document management, and how to create and design diagrams, collaborate on diagrams in a hybrid environment, and convey information through diagrams to drive alignment and action across teams.
