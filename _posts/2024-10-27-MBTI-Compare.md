I've been working on an MBTI comparison project that allows you to select two different Myers-Briggs personality types and see how they compare in terms of Cognitive Functions.&#x20;

You can explore the demo of the app [here](https://yurigushiken.github.io/MBTI-Compare/).

The goal of this app is to help synthesize complex personality data into meaningful insights that can be applied to improve communication and understanding between individuals.

Feel free to try it out and see how your personality type aligns with others!

For more details about the project, you can check out the demo link above.
