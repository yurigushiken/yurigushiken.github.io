I created a Voice-to-Notion app with Python that transcribes voice files and inputs them into Notion, a note-taking app. It uses the OpenAI API for WhisperAI and GPT-3 for transcription and summary generation, as well as Google Cloud Services and Notion APIs. The app runs on Google Cloud continuously, waiting for new voice files to enter a folder. The reason for creating this app was that the applications on the market did not do exactly what I wanted and needed.
