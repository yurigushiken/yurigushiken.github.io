During the pandemic, I started a student-focused podcast to give a voice to my students who were home for months and missed school. I was the main host, producer, and editor. I used a Tascam recorder, four XLR microphones, Audacity for editing, and had two co-hosts. I took great care in providing value to my listeners and producing high-quality sound.
