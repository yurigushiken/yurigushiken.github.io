Alright, Sam, let's do this. How about we start with something relatable? Maybe dating in New York?

Hey Mark, dating in New York is like job hunting...

Yeah, Sam, dating in New York is like job hunting... you apply for a bunch of positions, get ghosted by most, and the ones that call you back are just trying to sell you a pyramid scheme.

Mark, what do you think? Maybe we can tighten it up a bit.Current message connection id:  25ab4c6b-8358-4d38-923f-0eec92ecd6da

Nice, Sam! Let's trim it down for impact. How about:

---

"Dating in New York is like job hunting: you get ghosted, rejected, and the ones that call back are just pyramid schemes."

I like it, Mark! Short and punchy. How about we add a little twist for the punchline?

"Dating in New York is like job hunting: you get ghosted, rejected, and the ones that call back are just pyramid schemes... or living with their parents."

Reviewing the joke.

Reasons why it does not meet the standards:

1. **Punchline**: The punchline lacks a strong element of surprise or unexpected twist.
2. **Economy of words**: The joke could be more concise.
3. **Exaggeration**: Needs stronger exaggeration to emphasize the humor.
4. **Relatability**: Could be more relatable by focusing on a more common experience.
5. **Misdirection**: The misdirection isn't strong enough to create a significant humorous surprise.

Alright, Sam, let's punch this up with more exaggeration and a stronger twist. How about:

---

"Dating in New York is like job hunting: you get ghosted, rejected, and if they call you back, they're either a pyramid scheme or a mime."

---

What do you think?

Sam-Morril (to group-chat-manager):

That's a good start, Mark! The mime twist is unexpected. Let's tighten it up a bit more for economy.

---

"Dating in New York is like job hunting: ghosted, rejected, or you end up with a mime."

Reviewing the joke.

Reasons why it does not meet the standards:

1. **Setup**: The setup is clear and relatable.
2. **Punchline**: The punchline is unexpected but could use more impact.
3. **Economy of words**: The joke is concise but could be tighter.
4. **Exaggeration**: The exaggeration is moderate; could be more extreme for humor.
5. **Misdirection**: The misdirection is present but lacks a strong flip.
6. **Timing**: Pacing is decent but could be sharper.
7. **Rule of three**: Properly structured, but the third item could be more surprising.
