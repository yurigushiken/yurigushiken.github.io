"Dating in New York is like job hunting: ghosted, rejected, or you end up with a mime."

The above joke was crafted by a team of AI agents.  

This is a demonstration of an [Autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) workflow with three agents: Two comedians (Mark-Normand) and (Sam Morril), overseen by one Joke-Director.

To see how the agents arrived at that joke please see the conversation:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yuri: Please write a joke

<span style="color:#569cd6;">Joke-Director</span> (<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">to group-chat-manager</span>):
Mark-Normand, Sam-Morril, write a joke.

<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Mark-Normand</span> (<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">to group-chat-manager</span>):
Alright, Sam, let's do this. How about we start with something relatable? Maybe dating in New York?

<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Hey Mark, dating in New York is like job hunting...</span>

<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Sam-Morril</span> (<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">to group-chat-manager</span>):
Yeah, Sam, dating in New York is like job hunting... you apply for a bunch of positions, get ghosted by most, and the ones that call you back are just trying to sell you a pyramid scheme.

Mark, what do you think? Maybe we can tighten it up a bit.

<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Mark-Normand</span> (<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">to group-chat-manager</span>):
Nice, Sam! Let's trim it down for impact. How about:

<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">"Dating in New York is like job hunting: you get ghosted, rejected, and the ones that call back are just pyramid schemes."</span>

<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Sam-Morril</span> (<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">to group-chat-manager</span>):
I like it, Mark! Short and punchy. How about we add a little twist for the punchline?

<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">"Dating in New York is like job hunting: you get ghosted, rejected, and the ones that call back are just pyramid schemes... or living with their parents."</span>

What do you think?

<span style="color:#569cd6;">Joke-Director</span> (<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">to group-chat-manager</span>):
Reviewing the joke.

Reasons why it does not meet the standards:

<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Punchline: The punchline lacks a strong element of surprise or unexpected twist.</span>
<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Economy of words: The joke could be more concise.</span>
<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Exaggeration: Needs stronger exaggeration to emphasize the humor.</span>
<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Relatability: Could be more relatable by focusing on a more common experience.</span>
<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Misdirection: The misdirection isn't strong enough to create a significant humorous surprise.</span>
<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Revise and resubmit.</span>

<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Mark-Normand</span> (<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">to group-chat-manager</span>):
Alright, Sam, let's punch this up with more exaggeration and a stronger twist. How about:

<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">"Dating in New York is like job hunting: you get ghosted, rejected, and if they call you back, they're either a pyramid scheme or a mime."</span>

What do you think?

<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Sam-Morril</span> (<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">to group-chat-manager</span>):
That's a good start, Mark! The mime twist is unexpected. Let's tighten it up a bit more for economy.

<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">"Dating in New York is like job hunting: ghosted, rejected, or you end up with a mime."</span>

What do you think?

<span style="color:#569cd6;">Joke-Director</span> (<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">to group-chat-manager</span>):
Reviewing the joke.

Reasons why it does not meet the standards:

<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Setup: The setup is clear and relatable.</span>
<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Punchline: The punchline is unexpected but could use more impact.</span>
<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Economy of words: The joke is concise but could be tighter.</span>
<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Exaggeration: The exaggeration is moderate; could be more extreme for humor.</span>
<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Misdirection: The misdirection is present but lacks a strong flip.</span>
<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Timing: Pacing is decent but could be sharper.</span>
<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Rule of three: Properly structured, but the third item could be more surprising.</span>
<span style="color:#dcdcaa;">Revise and resubmit.</span>
