This is an [Autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) workflow with three agents: Two comedians (Mark-Normand) and (Sam Morril), overseen by one Joke-Director.

The delivered joke: "Dating in New York is like job hunting: ghosted, rejected, or you end up with a mime.

Read the conversation to see how the agents team arriived at that joke:

Yuri: Please write a joke

Joke-Director ( to group-chat-manager )
Mark-Normand, Sam-Morril, write a joke.

Mark-Normand ( to group-chat-manager )
Alright, Sam, let's do this. How about we start with something relatable? Maybe dating in New York?

Hey Mark, dating in New York is like job hunting...

Sam-Morril ( to group-chat-manager )
Yeah, Sam, dating in New York is like job hunting... you apply for a bunch of positions, get ghosted by most, and the ones that call you back are just trying to sell you a pyramid scheme.

Mark, what do you think? Maybe we can tighten it up a bit.

Mark-Normand ( to group-chat-manager )
Nice, Sam! Let's trim it down for impact. How about:

"Dating in New York is like job hunting: you get ghosted, rejected, and the ones that call back are just pyramid schemes."

Sam-Morril ( to group-chat-manager )
I like it, Mark! Short and punchy. How about we add a little twist for the punchline?

"Dating in New York is like job hunting: you get ghosted, rejected, and the ones that call back are just pyramid schemes... or living with their parents."

What do you think?

Joke-Director ( to group-chat-manager )
Reviewing the joke.

Reasons why it does not meet the standards:

Punchline: The punchline lacks a strong element of surprise or unexpected twist.
Economy of words: The joke could be more concise.
Exaggeration: Needs stronger exaggeration to emphasize the humor.
Relatability: Could be more relatable by focusing on a more common experience.
Misdirection: The misdirection isn't strong enough to create a significant humorous surprise.
Revise and resubmit.

Mark-Normand ( to group-chat-manager )
Alright, Sam, let's punch this up with more exaggeration and a stronger twist. How about:

"Dating in New York is like job hunting: you get ghosted, rejected, and if they call you back, they're either a pyramid scheme or a mime."

What do you think?

Sam-Morril ( to group-chat-manager )
That's a good start, Mark! The mime twist is unexpected. Let's tighten it up a bit more for economy.

"Dating in New York is like job hunting: ghosted, rejected, or you end up with a mime."

What do you think?

Joke-Director ( to group-chat-manager )
Reviewing the joke.

Reasons why it does not meet the standards:

Setup: The setup is clear and relatable.
Punchline: The punchline is unexpected but could use more impact.
Economy of words: The joke is concise but could be tighter.
Exaggeration: The exaggeration is moderate; could be more extreme for humor.
Misdirection: The misdirection is present but lacks a strong flip.
Timing: Pacing is decent but could be sharper.
Rule of three: Properly structured, but the third item could be more surprising.
Revise and resubmit.
