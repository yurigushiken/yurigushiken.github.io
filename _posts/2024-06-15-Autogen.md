## "Dating in New York is like job hunting: ghosted, rejected, or you end up with a mime."

## The above joke was crafted by a team of AI agents.  

## This is a demonstration of an [Autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) workflow with three agents: Two comedians (Mark-Normand) and (Sam Morril), overseen by one Joke-Director.

## To see how the agents arrived at that joke please see the conversation:

<span style="color: #569CD6;">Yuri (to group-chat-manager)</span>: Please write a joke

<span style="color: #DCDCAA;">Joke-Director (to group-chat-manager)</span>:
<span style="color: #569CD6;">Mark-Normand, Sam-Morril, write a joke.</span>

<span style="color: #569CD6;">Mark-Normand (to group-chat-manager)</span>: Alright, Sam, let's do this. How about we start with something relatable? Maybe dating in New York?

<span style="color: #569CD6;">Sam-Morril (to group-chat-manager)</span>: Hey Mark, dating in New York is like job hunting...

<span style="color: #569CD6;">Sam-Morril (to group-chat-manager)</span>: Yeah, Sam, dating in New York is like job hunting... you apply for a bunch of positions, get ghosted by most, and the ones that call you back are just trying to sell you a pyramid scheme. Mark-Normand, what do you think? Maybe we can tighten it up a bit.

<span style="color: #569CD6;">Mark-Normand (to group-chat-manager)</span>: Nice, Sam! Let's trim it down for impact. How about:

<span style="color: #D69D85;">"Dating in New York is like job hunting: you get ghosted, rejected, and the ones that call back are just pyramid schemes."</span>

<span style="color: #569CD6;">Sam-Morril (to group-chat-manager)</span>: I like it, Mark! Short and punchy. How about we add a little twist for the punchline?

<span style="color: #D69D85;">"Dating in New York is like job hunting: you get ghosted, rejected, and the ones that call back are just pyramid schemes... or living with their parents."</span>

What do you think?

<span style="color: #DCDCAA;">Joke-Director (to group-chat-manager)</span>: Reviewing the joke.

Reasons why it does not meet the standards:
- **Punchline**: The punchline lacks a strong element of surprise or unexpected twist.
- **Economy of words**: The joke could be more concise.
- **Exaggeration**: Needs stronger exaggeration to emphasize the humor.
- **Relatability**: Could be more relatable by focusing on a more common experience.
- **Misdirection**: The misdirection isn't strong enough to create a significant humorous surprise.

Revise and resubmit.

<span style="color: #569CD6;">Mark-Normand (to group-chat-manager)</span>: Alright, Sam, let's punch this up with more exaggeration and a stronger twist. How about:

<span style="color: #D69D85;">"Dating in New York is like job hunting: you get ghosted, rejected, and if they call you back, they're either a pyramid scheme or a mime."</span>

What do you think?

<span style="color: #569CD6;">Sam-Morril (to group-chat-manager)</span>: That's a good start, Mark! The mime twist is unexpected. Let's tighten it up a bit more for economy.
