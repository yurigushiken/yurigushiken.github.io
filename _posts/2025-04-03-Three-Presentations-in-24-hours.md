The first two days of April was period of sharing my and my lab's recent work in numerical cognition and neuroscience, education technology, and research methods at two conferences and one event: Cognitive Neuroscience Society (CNS) annual meeting, Teachers College's STEAMnasium, and Columbia's Data Science Day.

### Cognitive Neuroscience Society (CNS) 2025 (Monday, 1 April)

At the annual CNS meeting in Boston LCN lab members and I presented findings from our EEG study on how the brain processes small versus large numerical quantities. We looked at ERP components N1 and P3b during a numerical change detection task.

On Wednesday, I presented at the annual STEAMnasium event hosted by the Mathematics, Science & Technology (MST) department at Teachers College, Columbia University. 

My cohort members (Winnie Liu, Melissa De Sole, Giles Bullen) and I, all part of the [Technology Specialist MA program](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/cmltd/academics/degrees--requirements/technology-specialist-ma-initial/), presented activities reflecting our work in K-12 school placements this year. Thank you to Giles for coordinating with organizers for our presentation space.

### Columbia Data Science Day 2025 (Wednesday, 2 April)

Lastly, my research partner, Yuexin Li, and I presented our methods research at Columbia University's Data Science Day on April 2nd. 

We presented "Eye-Track-ML," a machine learning pipeline developed to automate the frame-by-frame coding of eye-tracking videos. This tool significantly increases speed of coding of gaze data, which we innovated for our infant event representation research. Our pipeline uses YOLOv11 and SAM2.1. You can learn more about the project from our related [AI Summit contribution](/academic/research/2025/03/04/Columbia-AI-Summit-poster-contribution.html).

We got excellent feedback from conference attendees. We also met several students interested in joining our lab, including one who has officially joined our lab after meeting Yuexin and me at Columbia Data Science Day.
