Yuexin Li and I had the pleasure of presenting our [Eye-Track-ML project](/academic/research/2025/03/04/Columbia-AI-Summit-poster-contribution.html) as guest lecturers in Dr. Jean Tang-Lonardo's BBSN 5022 course. We provided her class of 20 students with insights into eye-tracking methodology and dynamic data analysis in the context of developmental research.

Our presentation covered the challenges of traditional manual coding methods and how our automated pipeline using computer vision models significantly streamlines the process. This builds upon some of the machine learning concepts we explored in our earlier [Coding Machine](/2025/01/04/Coding-Machine.html) project but applied specifically to eye-tracking analysis.

The students showed particular interest in how our approach could be applied to their own research questions and the potential for cross-disciplinary applications in cognitive neuroscience.
