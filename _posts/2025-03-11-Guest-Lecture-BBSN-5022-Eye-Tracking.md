My lab partner, Yuexin Li, and I presented our [Eye-Track-ML project](/academic/research/2025/03/04/Columbia-AI-Summit-poster-contribution.html) as guest lecturers in Dr. Jean Tang-Lonardo's BBSN 5022 course.

We presented the challenges of traditional manual coding methods and how our automated pipeline using computer vision models streamlines the process. For more information see our [Coding Machine](/automation/tools/2025/01/04/Coding-Machine.html) project.
