Yuexin Li and I had the pleasure of presenting our [Eye-Track-ML project](/academic/research/2025/03/04/Columbia-AI-Summit-poster-contribution.html) as guest lecturers in Dr. Jean Tang-Lonardo's BBSN 5022 course. We provided her class of 20 students with insights into eye-tracking methodology and dynamic data analysis in the context of developmental research.

We presented the challenges of traditional manual coding methods and how our automated pipeline using computer vision models significantly streamlines the process. For more information see our earlier [Coding Machine](/automation/tools/2025/01/04/Coding-Machine.html) project.
