<p>I am a self-taught at the Thai lanuage. I used a spaced-repetition flashcard program called Anki to make over 2000 unique flashcards to help me. I was also inspired by fomer Singaporean Prime Minister and adult language learner Lee Kwan Yew and his book "Keeping My Mandarin Alive", who started learned Mandarin at the age of 32. </p>
