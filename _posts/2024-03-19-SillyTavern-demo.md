**Silly Tavern demonstration – Persona/Voice clone**

Posted on March 19, 2024

This is a technology demonstration (many local servers + external APIs) of using Silly Tavern UI to chat with a character designed after myself called “Yuuri” (two “u” to distinguish from myself “Yuri”).

I have questions on the possibilities for cognitive science and psychology research. Potential areas to explore include the impact on self-perception, learning and retention, confidence and self-efficacy, therapy and mental health applications, and advancements in human-computer interaction.

These are just ideas and speculations.

This project brings together many technologies: SillyTavern, XTTS API server, SillyTavern-Extras server, OpenAI Whisper, and Claude 3 Haiku, connected through multiple servers and environments
