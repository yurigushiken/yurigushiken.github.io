**Experimentation: AI-Town**

Posted on December 31, 2023

This is AI town, which can theoretically be used to simulate humans for study. I am interested in this.

This experiment cost 1 cent per second to run (on GPT-3.5 Turbo) – quite expensive.

I ran it for around an hour, watching the interactions between the characters. I was unable to get logs of each character’s reflections or interactions or of what the backend was doing. I am still looking for these for study on how the application works, and where my $11 went.
