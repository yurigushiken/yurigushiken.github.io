**Experimentation: AI-Town**

Posted on December 31, 2023

This is AI town, which can theoretically be used to simulate humans for study. 

I ran it for around less than an hour (cost: $11), watching the interactions between the characters. I was unable to get logs of each character's reflections or interactions or of what the backend was doing. I am still looking for these for study on how the application works, and where my $11 went.

This is an early experiment. I'm looking forward to upgrades like RAG.
