I made a six hundred frame animation starting from an original video. I isolated each frame with DaVinci Resolve, processed each frame through Stable Diffusion with an anime checkpoint, removed the background with Runway ML, generated a dynamic background with the Stable Diffusion Deforum function, and overlayed the isolated subject over the background with DaVinci Resolve.



### Software Used
- Stable Diffusion with Deforum
- DaVinci Resolve
- Runway ML

This is a tutorial-based project. I followed a tutorial by Matt Wolfe on YouTube: [Watch the Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGR_e6q-bs&t=484s)
