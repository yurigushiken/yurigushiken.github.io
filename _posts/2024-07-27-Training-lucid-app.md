"Mind mapping is a skill that helps us engage in the right thinking processes to build the knowledge."

"Reducing a necessary words forces you to synthesize and summarize."

I completed the "Diagramming Foundations" course offered by Lucid. These skills are to help me synthesize information I learn and practice for using these techniques with learners.
