I completed the "AI Agentic Design Patterns with AutoGen" course offered by DeepLearning.AI. This comprehensive course covered multi-agent conversation, sequential chats, and planning  with AI.

This course provided a fundamental understanding of working with AI agents, focusing on raw usage rather than automation, to understand the fundamentals of AI agents.
