## Parametric Faces

This was my first time using TurtleStitch. I like that there is greater flexibility and more standard measurements for color. One other feature that I ended up using was the built-in protractor. However, calculating angles in my head is something I enjoy when using TurtleArt and TurlteStitch. Some people do not like doing mental geometry calculations, so it’s good for them that it’s there.

My parametric face has several points of variability, depending on chosen hair. The points of variability are the following: eyebrow thickness, eyelash length, eye color, mouth color, hair color, hair length.

There are about 24 custom blocks in the script. The face and hair are mostly symmetrical. Both sides of the y-axis have mirrored code.

I made heavy use of the arc movement, to emphasize subtlety.

Below are variations. The variation in the center has hair V1. That hair has fun elements of randomness.

This was a fun project that I worked on over some evenings. I am gaining fluency with thinking computationally and creating and using variables in programming.
