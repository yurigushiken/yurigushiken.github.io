This project is designed to serve as a tool for researchers, hobbyists, urban/rural planners, and community members, marking the location of each mound in the USA. It aims to raise awareness of the mound problem, while aiding in research in the study of their origin.
This tool allows researchers to:
Study mounds from new perspectives
Perform statistical analysis on data
Use mounds data in various spatial formats
Use mounds data in various software
