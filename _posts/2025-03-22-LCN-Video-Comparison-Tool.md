We developed a specialized data visualization tool for the Language and Cognition Lab at Teachers College, Columbia University. The [LCN Video Comparison Tool](https://yurigushiken.github.io/LCN-video-viewer/) helps researchers compare multiple experimental videos simultaneously with frame-by-frame precision.

The tool solves a critical research problem: comparing participants' responses across multiple experimental conditions. Its frame-precise synchronization reveals subtle behavioral patterns that would otherwise remain hidden in sequential viewing.

Key capabilities include:
- Synchronized playback of multiple videos
- Frame-by-frame navigation (1/30th of a second precision)
- Customizable grid layouts (1×1, 1×2, 2×2, 2×3)
- Leader video designation that others follow
- Precise frame jumping across all videos

This project exemplifies our approach to research tooling: identify the specific need, build the simplest effective solution, and ensure it works reliably in real research environments.
