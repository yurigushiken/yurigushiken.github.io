Technology Demonstration: 
I used a paid version of ElevenLabs to create my voice based on a one-minute sample of me talking. ElevenLabs also made my voice speak French. I used Lalamu to make my mouth move with my French-speaking voice. I added subtitles.

### Example Video

These software were developed in the last few months (June, 2023).
