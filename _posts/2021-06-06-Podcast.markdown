I started a student-focused podcast to give a voice to my students who were home for months and missed school. I had co-hosts 'Em' and 'Chief', both friends from work. I was producer, editor, and manager of the posts and social media. We used a Tascam recorder, four XLR microphones, and Audacity for editing. 

We spent many hours recording and producing shows. We brought microphones to school and students told stories about their experiences. At our peak we had 50 weekly downloads, totally over a hundred. We suppose most downloads were students at our school.
