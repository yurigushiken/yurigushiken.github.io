I adopted spaced-repetition to study Thai Language using a flashcard program called Anki to make over 2000 unique flashcards of words and phrases with consideration for meaning and sentiment. 
I asked my Thai teacher and Thai-speaking friends for ways to convey what I wanted in their own words, if they were in these situations. 

This was an exercise in pattern recognition and disciplined documentation. Each time I was in a situation where I wanted to express something and I could not do it I would write it down and ask my Thai teacher. I would get the answer from her and make a flashcard for it. 
I would use the flashcards to practice and I would be ready for the next time that situation occured. 

When I began learning Thai language I was already twenty six years old, and I felt crushingly challenged when first starting to learn. I saw Lee Kwan Yew in an interview discuss the awkward positiong he was in as a Singaporean political leader of Chinese ancestry but not speaking Mandarin. He began learning in his 30s, and I think his is a inspiring story in adult learning.
