Our 4th grade students recently participated in an exciting machine learning project using Google's Teachable Machine. While we based our approach on Ready AI's methodology, we modified the lesson to focus on artistic styles rather than fish identification. Students collected images of famous artists' works, trained the model to recognize distinctive styles (Picasso, Van Gogh, etc.), and deliberately set aside some images as a testing set that the model would never see during training.

This hands-on experience directly addressed several key NYS Computer Science and Digital Fluency Standards, particularly 4-6.IC.5 (explaining how computer systems play a role in human decision-making) and 4-6.CT.1 (developing a computational model showing changes in output when inputs change). Students witnessed firsthand how the model's confidence levels fluctuated when presented with new artistic examples, sparking discussions about AI reliability and bias.

The most valuable learning moment came when testing the "never seen" images, addressing standard 4-6.CT.3 (visualizing data to highlight relationships). Students analyzed why certain artistic styles were easier for the machine to identify than others, and developed hypotheses about feature recognition. This project also incorporated standards 4-6.DL.2 and 4-6.DL.4 as students collaborated using digital tools to create and refine their machine learning models. The enthusiasm was contagious - several students have already asked when they can build their next AI project!
