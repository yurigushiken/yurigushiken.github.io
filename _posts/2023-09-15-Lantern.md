## Ancient Pattern One

![Pyramid](/media/american-8-2.png)

**“Pyramid”** is inspired by (most famously) Native American zigzag or chevron patterns. 

The script starts with a single parallelogram in the bottom left, and completes a column up.

The script is variable wherein changing the number of “repeat” shapes per column shortens the overall pattern.

The code uses all three available variables and nine capped sections. I attempted to also control for size of each parallelogram, but did not test frequently enough, and thus this function does not work. This was a lesson learned – to run the code frequently, perhaps even after each modification.

### Examples of Repeat Values
![Repeat 1](/media/Screenshot-2023-09-15-232027-768x614.png) **repeat = 1**
![Repeat 3](/media/american-screenshot-repeat-3-1-768x613.png) **repeat = 3**
![Repeat 6](/media/american-8-3-768x614.png) **repeat = 6**

### Attempts at Variable Sizes
![Variable Size Smaller](/media/american-screenshot-size-50-2048x1639.png) **Attempt at variable size (smaller)**
![Variable Size 60](/media/american-8-2.png) **side length: 60**
![Variable Size Larger](/media/american-screenshot-size-70-2048x1636.png) **Attempt at variable size (larger)**

## Ancient Pattern Two

![Meander](/media/Screenshot-2023-09-16-222738-2-2048x1639.png)

**“Meander”** is an ancient pattern commonly attributed to ancient Greeks. The pattern is also known as a Greek Key.

In my first attempt, I tried drawing the shape of a single key and repeating the pattern. It became clear that it would be difficult to make a perfectly circular shape. I was set on making the Meander pattern, so I took a new approach.

Working from the outside-in, I found an example pattern and segmented the design into 9 layers, and traced each line with a black pencil after completing the line in WebTurtleArt.
