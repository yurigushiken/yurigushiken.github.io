## Ancient Pattern One

![Pyramid](/media/american-8-2.png)

**“Pyramid”** is inspired by (most famously) Native American zigzag or chevron patterns. 

The script starts with a single parallelogram in the bottom left, and completes a column up.

The script is variable wherein changing the number of “repeat” shapes per column shortens the overall pattern.

The code uses all three available variables and nine capped sections. I attempted to also control for size of each parallelogram, but did not test frequently enough, and thus this function does not work. This was a lesson learned – to run the code frequently, perhaps even after each modification.

### Examples of Repeat Values
![Repeat 1](/media/Screenshot-2023-09-15-232027-768x614.png) **repeat = 1**
![Repeat 3](/media/american-screenshot-repeat-3-1-768x613.png) **repeat = 3**
![Repeat 6](/media/american-8-3-768x614.png) **repeat = 6**

### Attempts at Variable Sizes
![Variable Size Smaller](/media/american-screenshot-size-50-2048x1639.png) **Attempt at variable size (smaller)**
![Variable Size 60](/media/american-8-2.png) **side length: 60**
![Variable Size Larger](/media/american-screenshot-size-70-2048x1636.png) **Attempt at variable size (larger)**

## Ancient Pattern Two

![Meander](/media/Screenshot-2023-09-16-222738-2-2048x1639.png)

**“Meander”** is an ancient pattern commonly attributed to ancient Greeks. The pattern is also known as a Greek Key.

In my first attempt, I tried drawing the shape of a single key and repeating the pattern. It became clear that it would be difficult to make a perfectly circular shape. I was set on making the Meander pattern, so I took a new approach.

Working from the outside-in, I found an example pattern and segmented the design into 9 layers, and traced each line with a black pencil after completing the line in WebTurtleArt.

Magin and Kelly were friendly and helpful in the Thingspace. I appreciate learning to use Adobe Illustrator a bit better, and learning to use the laser printing machine, as well as the vinyl cutter.

I used a lightbulb holder ($9 Amazon) and a WiZ LED Lightbulb (E27) to illuminate the lantern. Light is diffused through five sheets of stabilizer material.

## Reflecting on TurtleArt design

![Reflection](/media/20230922_232159-2048x1536.jpg)

Looking at the lamp at 45°, the otherwise straight (I think) lines distort to look crooked. I like this effect, but upon redesign I would take this into consideration (as I originally planned!) and control for parallelogram (variable) size.

Another potential design modification would be making a rectangular design with flush edges, meaning cutting out the would-be cut-off parallelograms.
