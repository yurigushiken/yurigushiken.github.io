extra The Carnac stones in Brittany, France, form an exceptionally dense collection of megalithic sites, with over 3,000 prehistoric standing stones erected by the pre-Celtic people of Brittany. These alignments date from the Neolithic period, roughly 4500 BCE to 3300 BCE, making them older than Stonehenge. The arrangements include long rows of menhirs, dolmens (stone tombs), and tumuli (burial mounds). While their exact purpose remains a subject of debate, theories range from astronomical observatories to religious sites or territorial markers, reflecting a sophisticated understanding of landscape and a deeply ingrained ritualistic culture of the Neolithic peoples.
