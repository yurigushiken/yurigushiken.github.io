# About

I'm a researcher and developer at the Language and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at Columbia University, where I develop tools and methodologies for analyzing eye-tracking data and infant cognitive development. My work focuses on creating computational solutions that enhance research capabilities through automation and visualization.

Currently, I'm integrating machine learning and computer vision into developmental psychology research workflows, with projects including automated eye-tracking analysis systems and frame-precise video synchronization tools for experimental data visualization.
